Loop - 50fps

    Idle loop runs all the time, updates all animations
        -idle animations update every 8 idle loops (CONFIG.IDLE_ANIMATION_SLOW_FACTOR)
        -updates level
        -moves time foward
        -no turns occur
        -idle animation can be interrupted by active animation (attack, move, ability, wait, etc)

    Active loops updates player and mobs 
        -represents a 'turn'
        -runs when there is input to process
        -can be queued via input queue
        -turn speed is dictated by animation length, you may be able to get multiple turns during some enemy animations
